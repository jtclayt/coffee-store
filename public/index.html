  This is a website for a fake coffee company. It uses one html page to
  simulate a multi page store front with a landing page, the store and an
  about section. The single page nature allows for a more seamless user
  experience and saves user cart info if they navigate away from store page.

  This links to a local source file in /css of the Bootstrap files as it was the most
  reliable way to ensure the source properly loads. Using their CDN link was not
  working very well at the time of making this project and TA Conner Ardman
  recommended this workaround.

  All the coffee and coffee images are from Valhalla Coffee which is a small
  batch roast with a store in Tacoma, WA. They have some really good coffee
  that I would recommend trying out!

          <h2>About Our Company</h2>
          <p>
            PF roasting originally started as a food service business in 2008
            selling corn, potatoes, turkey legs, and other fair foods at
            festivals and rodeos around Washington state. It was founded by my
            dad who enjoyed traveling and cooking food. After I joined the
            Marine corps in 2010 he continued to do food services for a time
            but eventually sold off the equipment for the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I was stationed as a security guard at the US Embassy in
            Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo I began roasting coffee
            as a way to supply myself coffee at a cheaper price. I started
            roasting with just a bag of green beans and frying pan. I quickly
            discovered enjoyment in this newfound hobby and would spend the
            next 3 years travelling across the globe to various posts taking my
            coffee roasting supplies with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every post I was stationed at I would try to provide my coffee
            to my fellow marines and tell them of the quality and flavor of
            fresh roasted beans. At this point I had roasted beans from every
            coffee proucing country in the world and had used various methods
            to roast them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016, I returned home from the Marine Corps and I convinced my
            dad to take up the hobby of roasting coffee and we began investing
            in better equipment until we had a good home batch coffee roasting
            set up. It was at this point that PF roasting, which was still
            owned by my dad, was converted from a food service company to a
            coffee roasting company.
          </p>
          <p><em>
            This information is mostly true, except for the part about
            PF roasting becoming a coffee roasting company.
