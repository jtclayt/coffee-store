          <p>
            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
            praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
            expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
            of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
            pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues
            or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances
            occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
            example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain
            some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses
            to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant pleasure?
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
            beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire,
            that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame
            belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
            saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy
            to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
            nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
            welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims
            of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
            to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these
            matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
            pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
          </p>
